Your game is not currently supported, sorry.

You need to perform a full install of your game and make sure that the .ini points to the correct paths.

You need to install the latest patch (which would be Trials of the Luremaster if you're on Heart of Winter) and make sure you aren't installing the mod twice (which includes attempting to install it on EasyTutu or a cloned install when it is already installed on your main install).
